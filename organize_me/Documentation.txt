Summary of Project:

	This project is to create a application that will help simplify and streamline organization by combining
calendars and reminders (along with some other functions like recuring payments and bills) so that people can get their life in order.  You can also
add recuring payments that you may have, and the algorithm will properly give you notifications to let you know when
a payment is upcoming so you don't get suprised and are able to budget your life better.
